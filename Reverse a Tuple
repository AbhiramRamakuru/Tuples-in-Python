# PROGRAM (Answer):

#1st Method

b = b[::-1]
print(b)


# #2nd Method
# s = input()
# s = s[::-1]
# print(tuple(s))


# #3rd Method   #Using Resversed function
# a = input()
# b = tuple(a)
# c = ()
# for i in reversed(b):
#     c = c + (i,)      # c=c+(i) gives error as (i) is an integer, but not a tuple
# print(c)
